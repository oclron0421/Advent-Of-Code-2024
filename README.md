# Advent-Of-Code-2024

## Day 1 
### Part 1
Not too bad, very good warm up, brain havent rot in NS yet XD
Solution is straight forward, just compare and add
### Part 2 
Still not too bad, involved more validation and checking as well as multiplication, data types is still not a concern

##Day 2
###Part 1 
Didnt read my input, coded based off the example input they gave which led me to using arrays as I initially thought that the numbers for each row would be fixed, READ YOUR INPUT BEFORE CODING ARGHHHHHH
