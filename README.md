# Advent-Of-Code-2024

## Day 1 
### Part 1
Not too bad, very good warm up, brain havent rot in NS yet XD
Solution is straight forward, just compare and add
### Part 2 
Still not too bad, involved more validation and checking as well as multiplication, data types is still not a concern

## Day 2
### Part 1 
Didnt read my input, coded based off the example input they gave which led me to using arrays as I initially thought that the numbers for each row would be fixed, READ YOUR INPUT BEFORE CODING ARGHHHHHH
### Part 2 
Took me forever to complete, brute force all the way, there has to be a wayyyyy more efficient solution to it...

## Day 3
### Part 1 
Might seem daunting but its very very doable
### Part 2
I hate regex, implemented the edge cases with the help of others, still no idea what went wrong ._.

## Day 4 
### Part 1
Very straightforward algorithm, quite a chill day 
### Part 2
Straightforward too, part 1 was harder XD

## Day 5 
### Part 1 
Different method of parsing in the input file, nothing too complicated. 
### Part 2 
Highlighted the usage and the idea of comparators, making a sorting algorithm within the puzzle's domain, nothing too tough

## Day 6 
### Part 1 
Rather straightforward, just turn the guard direction when needed to and mark out the visited points, tally up the visited the points and voila 
### Part 2 
Brtually brute force the path of the guard by adding a wall infront of the guard path which is stored int a queue, and the testing if the guard is stuck in a loop or it can exit.

## Day 7 
### Part 1 
Quite easy, need to be careful with the data typing, used long long -- numbers are too big
